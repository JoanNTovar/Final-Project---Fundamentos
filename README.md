Hi pal,
In this zip you can find the complete project which is divided in two parts, the first part you can find the .py and the other part have the .html
if you want to ejecute the program you need to create an account on playit.gg and create a tunnel, or if you want to only check that you can sent me a message to open the server.
Thanks for your patient and have a good day.
